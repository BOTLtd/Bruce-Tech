    <!-- DETAILED EXPLANATION -->
    <p>
      This service focuses on continuous monitoring of systems
      to identify potential issues before they cause failures.
    </p>

    <p>
      By tracking performance indicators and system behavior,
      we provide early warnings, maintenance alerts, and data-driven
      recommendations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preventative monitoring reduces downtime, lowers repair costs,
      and ensures long-term reliability of critical systems.
